2. matplotlib.pyplot
3. copy
4. PIL.Image

## Parameters
1. image_path: path of image, in format .png

3. D_OB: distance from observer to blackhole
4. D_SB: distance from source to blackhole
5. GRID_OB: definition of observer
6. scale: adjustable parameter, fit the target image onto the source plane. In the current setup, the image is
