# General_Relativity_Lensing
A project to simulate light bended by a black hole. Purely for fun. lol.

## Required packages:
1. numpy
2. matplotlib.pyplot
3. copy
4. PIL.Image

## Parameters
1. image_path: path of image, in format .png
2. GM: mass of blackhole
3. D_OB: distance from observer to blackhole
4. D_SB: distance from source to blackhole
5. GRID_OB: definition of observer
6. scale: adjustable parameter, fit the target image onto the source plane. In the current setup, if the image is 500*500 pixels, scale = 100 would fit.
7. angle of view is by default set to $50\degree^{2}$
